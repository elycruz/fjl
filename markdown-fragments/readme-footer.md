## Todos:
### MVP 1.0.0
- [ ] - Rename `pureCurry` and `pureCurryN` to `curry` and `curryN` respectively.
- [ ] - Rename old `curry{suffix}` functions to `curry{suffix}_` in lieu of previous change (also since 
these functions are overloaded and aren't pure curry functions due to their placeholder manipulation feature).
- [X] - ~~Remove functional operators (`zero`, `alt` etc.)  out into their own package (?) (tentative).~~
- [ ] - Make all functional members compatible with es6 classes.
